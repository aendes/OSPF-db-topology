This script takes the output of the cisco command "show ip ospf database network"
and generates a topology map using graphviz. Dark blue boxes are routers with 
their router ID, light blue boxes are the interconnecting networks.

The script is a little raw (could use more error checking etc) Feel free to improve it!
